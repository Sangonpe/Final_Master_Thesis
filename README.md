# Final_Master_Thesis
This code optimizes the energy arbitrage for any storage technologies that partake in the electricity Spot Markets of Spain 

This is my first attempt into creating software in Python

Most of this work is based on the work of https://github.com/klostest/energy_arbitrage_work_sample/blob/dca23256e8e642a4474c77407a7d8c4d395ac254/Energy%20arbitrage.ipynb

If you want to let me know how to improve the code (there are already many ways that I've thinked about), dont hesitate to contact me

Hopefully this code could help anyone to improve their knowledge about energy markets and how to model them

Thank you
